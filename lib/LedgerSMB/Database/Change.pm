=head1 NAME

LedgerSMB::Database::Change - Database change scripts for LedgerSMB

=head1 SYNOPSIS

my $dbchange = LedgerSMB::Database::Change->new(path => $path,
                                      properties => $properties);

my $content = $dbchange->content()
my $sha = $dbchange->sha();
my $content_wrapped = $dbchange->content_wrap($before, $after);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implements infrastructure to apply "schema-deltas" (schema-changes)
exactly once. Meaning that if a change has been applied succesfully,
it won't be applied again.

Note that this functionality isn't specific to LedgerSMB and mostly
mirrors PGObject::Util::DBChange and originates from that code.

=head2 Determination of 'has been applied before'

The criterion 'has been applied before' is determined by
the SHA512 of the content of the schema change file.  This leaves no
room for fixing the content of the schema change file as changing
the content means the schema change will be applied in all upgrades,
even if the older variant was succesfully applied (because the bug
which the fixed content addresses wasn't triggered on some upgrades).

To address the immutability concern, the following extension to the
immutability has been devised.  When a schema change file must be
changed/fixed, the original must be copied to a new file with an
added suffix of an at-sign and a sequence number. Here's an example:

   sql/changes/1.4/abc.sql -copy-> sql/changes/1.4/abc.sql@1
   sql/changes/1.4/abc.sql (changed).

The new file (C<abc.sql@1>) must not be added to the change mechanism's
LOADORDER file. If another change to C<abc.sql> is required, the
following happens:

   sql/changes/1.4/abc.sql -copy-> sql/changes/1.4/abc.sql@2
   sql/changes/1.4/abc.sql (changed again).

On upgrade, this module will detect that older versions of the file
exist and have been succesfully applied.  If that's the case, the
schema change file will be considered to be applied.

=head2 Receiving values from the driver in SQL

The SQL code can query properties of the LedgerSMB execution environment
using the C< current_setting() > function insofar as they are not available
in the C< defaults > table.  Setting names are prefixed
with C< lsmb_upgrade. >.

Currently, this module doesn't export any properties of the execution
environment.

=head2 Communication from SQL to driver

The driver (this module) listens on a channel named
C<< upgrade.<current database name> >> to receive messages from
the SQL script issued using the C< NOTIFY > statement or
C< pg_notify() > function.  The notify payload is a JSON structure
defining a message.  Each message has a C< type > field; types contain
additional fields as specified below.

Please do note that notify payloads are limited to 8000 characters.

=head3 feedback

This message type allows the upgrade script to indicate feedback to
be sent to the admin running the upgrade. It supports the following
fields:

=over

=item * content (string)

Contains the text of the feedback to the user. Contents of messages
with subsequent C<seq> values, will be appended before interpreting
this field.

The resulting string consists of a header followed by two newlines
and the actual content.  Contents without a header immediately starts
with two newline characters.

The header uses the same structure as MIME. A C< Content-Type > header
may be used to indicate the formatting of the content.  When no
content type is specified, it defaults to C< text/plain >.

=item * seq (integer)

Sequence number of the feedback message, in case content is split
across multiple messages (in order to stay below the 8,000 character
payload limit).

=item * id (string)

Required field in case the C<seq> field is used to marshall a set
of message parts.  All parts share the same C<id> value, with
different values across unrelated messages.

This value may be empty if C<seq> is null.

=item * roles (string[])

The list of roles (without their company prefix, i.e. as listed in
C< sql/modules/Roles.sql >) used to determine for which users this
feedback is applicable; users being assigned at least one of the
roles will be in the list of those notified. If this field is C<null>,
the feedback will not be shown in the application, instead being
restricted to admins through C< setup.pl > and C< ledgersmb-admin >.

=back

=head3 cleanup

B<NOTE> This message type is envisioned but not implemented yet.

This message type allows the upgrade script to indicate that - once
the upgrade has been tested and approved by the admin - a cleanup
step is required.

=over

=item * script (string)

The SQL command(s) to be executed to clean up after the upgrade.

=item * feedback_id (string)

The C< id > of the feedback describing the cleanup action to the user.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new($path, $properties, $run_id)

Constructor.

C<$run_id> is an optional UUID and may contain an identifier for the upgrade
run this change is invoked from.

C<$properties> is optional and a hashref with any of the following keys set:

=over

=item no_transactions

Do not group statements into a single transaction.

Note: as DBI/DBD::Pg never runs statements outside of transactions;
  code running in C<no_transactions> mode will run each statement
  in its own transaction.

=item reload_subsequent

If this one has changed, then reload further modules

=back

}

=head2 apply($dbh)

Applies the current file to the db in the current dbh. May issue
one or more C<$dbh->commit()>s; if there's a pending transaction on
a handle, C<$dbh->clone()> can be used to create a separate copy.

Returns no value in particular.

Throws an error in case of failure.

Future versions will allow properties to be specified in comment headers in
